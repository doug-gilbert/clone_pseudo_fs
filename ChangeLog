Linux utility for cloning pseudo filesystems like sysfs

Changelog for pre-release clone_pseudo_fs-0.90 [20231213] [svn: r25]
  - build framework for cloning pseudo file systems utility
  - add --cache option, slightly deeper if invoked twice
  - add --dereference= option, expects symlink as argument,
    sl->directory and sl->regular are dereferenced,
    sl->other treated as if this option not given
  - add --exclude=, --excl-fn= and options
    - make both apply to all node types
  - add --prune= option, argument expected to be a
    directory, symlink (to a dir) or a regular file
  - add examples directory with scripts generating minimal
    pseudo file system copies for ls* utilities
  - fix multiple license references so all refer
    to BSD-2-Clause
  - improve handling of large regular files
  - improve accuracy of 'Number of pruned nodes'
  - add experimental cmake support and keep autotools
  - state the compilers required: g++ 13 or clang++ 16,
    later versions of those compilers should work
    - re-instate support for g++ 12 and clang++ 15 which
      need package libfmt-dev installed for those older
      compilers
