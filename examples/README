The bash shell scripts in this directory identify what parts of /sys ,
/proc and /dev that need to be copied to make the various ls* utilities
work with their --sysroot= (or --sysfsroot= ) option.

Just using clone_pseudo_fs to copy all of /sys and then /proc may
expose exploitable data if the copied data is placed in a public
place such as a newsgroup or a web based equivalent. With that in
mind, the copies of /proc and /sys use the --exclude= , --excl-fn=
and --prune= options to reduce the amount of data copied.

On the author's laptop the reduction in the number nodes was around
a factor of 10 or more. More pruning could be done to reduce the
number of nodes further. The strace utility is a good way of seeing
exactly which files a ls* utility accesses. For example:
    strace lsblk >& /tmp/lsblk_strace.txt
